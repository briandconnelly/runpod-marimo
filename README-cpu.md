# runpod-marimo (CPU)

A Docker image that runs [marimo](https://marimo.io) as a notebook server on Runpod CPU pods.
Marimo is served on port **2971** and is accessible via Runpod's web proxy.

A GPU variant of this image is also published for CUDA-enabled pods — use a tag without the `-cpu` suffix (e.g., `0.5.5`).

## Reproducible notebooks by design

This image is designed so that every notebook is fully self-contained and reproducible anywhere.

Marimo is launched with [`--sandbox`](https://docs.marimo.io/guides/package_management/inlining_dependencies/), which runs each notebook in its own isolated `uv` environment built from the notebook's [PEP 723](https://peps.python.org/pep-0723/) inline script metadata.
When you install a package through marimo's built-in package manager, it is written directly into the notebook's header — the notebook carries its own dependency list and will run identically on any machine with `uv` installed.

This image also intentionally does **not** include marimo's `recommended` extras (polars, pandas, matplotlib, etc.).
Pre-installing packages would allow imports that work in the pod but have no record in the notebook, silently breaking reproducibility everywhere else.

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MARIMO_WORKSPACE` | Path to open in marimo's file browser | `/workspace` |
| `MARIMO_CACHE_DIR` | Parent directory for uv and Hugging Face caches | `$MARIMO_WORKSPACE/.cache` |
| `MARIMO_TOKEN_PASSWORD` | Password required to access the marimo UI; unset by default (no password) | _(unset)_ |

`/workspace` is where Runpod mounts network volumes, so notebooks created through the file browser automatically persist across pod stop/start when a volume is attached.
Without a volume, `/workspace` is a regular container directory (ephemeral).

`uv`'s sandbox cache (`UV_CACHE_DIR`) and the Hugging Face hub cache (`HF_HOME`) default to `$MARIMO_WORKSPACE/.cache/uv` and `$MARIMO_WORKSPACE/.cache/huggingface`, so downloaded notebook dependencies and models persist on the volume alongside the notebooks.

### Opting out of persistent caches

If you don't want the caches on the volume — e.g. the volume is small, you'd prefer faster local reads, or you're sharing a volume across pods — point `MARIMO_CACHE_DIR` at an in-container path:

```
MARIMO_CACHE_DIR=/home/runpod/.cache
```

That restores ephemeral container-local caches. The image's prewarmed `uvx marimo` cache lives at `/home/runpod/.cache/uv`, so first-boot launches are a cache hit.
`UV_CACHE_DIR` and `HF_HOME` can also be set individually to relocate either cache independently.

> **Shared volumes:** `HF_HOME` stores the Hugging Face auth token (`~/.cache/huggingface/token`), so a volume shared between pods will also share whoever is currently logged in with `huggingface-cli login`. If that's not what you want, keep `HF_HOME` off the shared volume (`HF_HOME=/home/runpod/.cache/huggingface`) while leaving `UV_CACHE_DIR` wherever you want it.

Access to the marimo server is gated by Runpod's proxy.
By default the image launches marimo with `--no-token` (no additional password required).
Set `MARIMO_TOKEN_PASSWORD` to require a password before the marimo UI is accessible.
Note that the password is passed as a command-line argument and is visible in `ps` output and `/proc/<pid>/cmdline` on the pod; it is not forwarded to SSH or notebook shells.

## What is included

- **marimo** with `lsp` (in-editor autocomplete, linting, and type checking via **ty**) and `mcp` extras
- **huggingface_hub** CLI for downloading models and datasets
- **GitHub CLI** (`gh`) and **runpodctl** for interacting with Runpod and GitHub from the terminal
- **DuckDB** CLI for querying files from the terminal
- Standard utilities: `git`, `curl`, `wget`, `jq`, `tmux`
